 Limitations and Known Issues
==============================

To make sure you have the best possible experience with SFM, you should be aware of the limitations and known issues:

* Changes to the hostname of server (e.g., from the reboot of an AWS EC2 instance) are not handled (`Ticket 435 <https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-ui/issues/435>`_) (see also `Troubleshooting <https://sfm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html>`_)

For a complete list of tickets, see https://github.com/gwu-libraries/sfm-ui/issues

In addition, you should be aware of the following:

* Access to the Weibo API is limited, so make sure you understand what can be collected.
* SFM does not currently provide a web interface for “replaying” the collected social media or web content.
